# Technology Modeling Language

LEMMA's documentation is currently work in progress. Therefore, to get an
impression of technology modeling in LEMMA, please refer to the corresponding
section of the LEMMA
[Tour](../../getting-started/tour/index.md#step-4-enrich-the-service-model-with-technology-information).

To dive into the design and implementation of LEMMA's Technology Modeling
Language, for now refer to Sections 4.4.2 and 5.3.2 of the dissertation that
conceived LEMMA[^1].
