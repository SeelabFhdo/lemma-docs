# User Guide

The user guide provides information for stakeholders interested in expressing
their concerns towards a microservice architecture from their specific
viewpoint. More precisely, LEMMA provides a set of different, viewpoint-specific
modeling languages to express such concerns in dedicated architecture models
that can later be integrated and used, e.g., to generate executable microservice
code.

The following table provides an overview of the viewpoints on microservice
architectures supported by LEMMA, and the addressed stakeholders and
corresponding LEMMA modeling languages:

| Viewpoint  | Stakeholders                                                                                    | Modeling Languages                                                      |

| Technology | Technology-Savvy Stakeholders, e.g., Microservice Developers, Operators, or Software Architects | [Technology Modeling Language](technology-modeling-language/index.md)   |

Please note that LEMMA's documentation is currently work in progress. Therefore,
the user guide is not complete yet and we will refer to sections in the
dissertation that conceived LEMMA[^1] whenever there exists no dedicated writing
for a certain article in the user guide yet.
