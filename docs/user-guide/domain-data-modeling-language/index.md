# Domain Data Modeling Language

LEMMA's documentation is currently work in progress. Therefore, to get an
impression on how to use LEMMA's Domain Data Modeling Language to construct
domain models that can be mapped to executable code, please refer to the
corresponding section of the LEMMA
[Tour](../../getting-started/tour/index.md#step-2-create-a-domain-model).

To dive into the design and implementation of LEMMA's Domain Data Modeling
Language, for now refer to Sections 4.4.1 and 5.3.1 of the dissertation that
conceived LEMMA[^1].
