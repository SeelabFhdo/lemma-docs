# Service Modeling Language

LEMMA's documentation is currently work in progress. Therefore, to get an
impression on how to use LEMMA's Service Modeling Language to construct
microservice models that can be mapped to executable code, please refer to
the corresponding section of the LEMMA
[Tour](../../getting-started/tour/index.md#step-3-create-a-service-model).

To dive into the design and implementation of LEMMA's Service Modeling Language,
for now refer to Sections 4.4.3 and 5.3.3 of the dissertation that conceived
LEMMA[^1].
