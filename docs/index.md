# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation of LEMMA---the **L**anguage **E**cosystem for
**M**odeling **M**icroservice **A**rchitecture.

LEMMA is an MDE
([Model-driven Engineering]({{ mde_def_url }})) solution that aims to facilitate
the design, development, and deployment of
[microservice architectures]({{ msa_def_url }}) through the use of

- **modeling languages** dedicated to the concise definition of microservices
including their *domain information* and *deployment specification*,
- **model transformations** allowing *automatic generation* of domain-specific
code, microservice code, and deployment configuration for heterogeneous
generation targets, and
- **model analysis** to support in detecting design smells microservice
architectures prior to their development and/or deployment.

## Take the Tour

If you have not yet heard of LEMMA, you may first want to have a look at its
[Context and Motivation](context-motivation) as well as the
[Feature Overview](feature-overview). In addition, you can read the
[Getting Started](getting-started) guide and then take the
[Tour](getting-started/tour) to get a first impression of LEMMA's practical
usage.

## User Guide

We provide a [User Guide](user-guide) as LEMMA's reference documentation. It
draws on the information provided by the [Getting Started](getting-started)
guide and the [Tour](getting-started/tour).

In case you encounter issues with the documentation, have further questions, or
any sort of feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us by creating an issue
in [LEMMA's GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeelabFhdo/lemma/) or dropping
us an [e-mail](mailto:{{ info_email }}).
