# Developer Guide

The developer guide provides information for everybody interested in the
technical details of LEMMA's implementation. Here, you will learn about the
design of LEMMA's modeling languages and other technical artifacts of the
ecosystem, e.g., the Model Processing Framework or the Java Base Generator.

Please note that LEMMA's documentation is currently work in progress. Therefore,
the developer guide is not complete yet and we will refer to sections in the
dissertation that conceived LEMMA[^1] whenever there exists no dedicated writing
for a certain article in the developer guide yet.

However, the following articles of the developer guide already comprise content
condensed and prepared for a broader audience:

- [Coding Style](coding-style/index.md)
- [Intermediate Model Specifications](intermediate-model-specifications/index.md)
- [Integrating New Modules With LEMMA's Continuous Integration Pipeline](continuous-integration/index.md)
