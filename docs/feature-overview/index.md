# Feature Overview

LEMMA constitutes a [model-driven]({{ mde_def_url }}) ecosystem that comes with
the following features in the design, development and, deployment of
[microservice architectures]({{ msa_def_url }}):

- **Concern-oriented Modeling Languages:** LEMMA aims to reduce the inherent
complexity of microservice architectures by providing its users with dedicated
modeling languages for the various challenges in the engineering of microservice
architectures. Specifically, these modeling languages languages focus on 
*domain-driven microservice design*, *technology-agnostic API modeling*, and
*concise deployment and operation specification*.  
  All modeling languages of LEMMA come with **IDE support** including syntax
highlighting, code completion, and as-you-type validation.

- **Practice-oriented:** LEMMA's modeling languages are inspired by the
requirements of real-world microservice architectures including distributed
development, DevOps-based teams, and technology heterogeneity.

- **Broad Applicability:** LEMMA has been used for, e.g., (i) the translation of
[domain-driven microservice designs into implementations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9226287);
(ii) [architecture recovery and quality attribute analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49418-6_21);
and (iii) [microservice code generation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31646-4_7).

- **Designed for Extensibility**: LEMMA is designed to be extensible, e.g., with
the support of new frameworks for microservice implementation or deployment.
Have a look at our [Developer Guide](../developer-guide) for the details.
